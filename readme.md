code in Payload<32|64>.dll search for

```cpp
UNICODE_STRING LdrpKernel32DllName = RTL_CONSTANT_STRING(L"KERNEL32.DLL");
```

inside ntdll, and if found - in new created process overwrite `KERNEL32.DLL` to own "bootstrap" dll name ( LdrpKernel<32|64>.dll )
as result LdrpKernel<32|64>.dll loaded to new process. currently it mast export 2 api:
BaseThreadInitThunk and TermsrvGetWindowsDirectoryW

```cpp
EXTERN_C
WINBASEAPI
NTSTATUS
FASTCALL
BaseThreadInitThunk(BOOL bInitializeTermsrv, 
  LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE lpStartAddress, 
  PVOID lpParameter
  );
```

`BaseThreadInitThunk` with `bInitializeTermsrv = true` called just before loader begin initialize static linked dlls from exe
we can here load Payload<32|64>.dll and initiaize it
as result code of Payload<32|64>.dll will be called not only before exe entry point (for this enough inject apc in first thread of new process)
but and before tls initializers and other dlls. sense only in early control.
inject work for all 4 cases ( 32-> 32, 32->64, 64->64, 64->32)
for 32->64 case need execute 64 bit code in wow process ( 64IN32 project)

test<64|32>.bat for test

Payload<32|64>.dll loaded to regsvr32.exe and started cmd.exe with inject
Payload<32|64>.dll hook CreateProcessInternalW for do inject to new created processes (if any)
